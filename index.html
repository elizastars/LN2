<br>Little Nightmares II is a popular puzzle-platformer horror adventure 
game. There is a lot of symbolism in themes throughtout the game that 
players can see and hear. One of the themes we will be diving into is 
how the game and German Expressionism intertwine. Let's get started!</br></p>
<h1><br>Gameplay & What's at Stake</br></h1> 
  <p class="big">
<br>In Little Nightmares II, you take on the role of Mono, a frail boy. 
    Mono has to be stealthy, work out puzzles, and even engage in 
    battles at times to stay alive in an extremely terrifying realm. It 
    is very important that you are silent and your movements are 
    well-timed. Mono is supported by Six, a friend who resembles a video 
    game character. Six gives help to Mono by removing barriers. This 
    backing strengthens the feeling in Mono that he really needs Six and 
    that he can trust her. Not only is it a matter of survival for Mono. 
    Reaching the Signal Tower is another part of his task. The Signal 
    Tower communicates with people in a way that harms them and makes the 
    world odd. To put an end to these messages, Mono has to get to the 
    Signal Tower. Little Nightmares II proves to be a journey of Mono to 
    the Signal Tower. In the end, the game turns its challenge into a war 
    against a cycle of control and trauma instead of just a matter of 
    escaping from danger.</br>

<h1><br>Little Nightmares II Lore</br></h1>
  <p class="big">
<br>Little Nightmares II follows Mono as he encounters Six and travels to the 
Signal Tower, the origin of a corrupting broadcast, via a warped world. Mono's 
bond with televisions and the Tower grows as they endure more dangerous 
surroundings, suggesting a more dire outcome. Six is changed inside the Tower, 
and Mono has to face the powers ruling the world. By the time the story ends, 
Mono has been abandoned, caught in a vicious cycle, and transformed into the 
monster he feared.</br></p>
<h1><br>Meet the Characters!</br></h1>

<p class="big">
<br>Mono is a small, silent boy with a personality 
  of vulnerability and persistence. He uses a paper 
  bag for hiding and protection. Even though he 
  lacks physical strength, he shows his inner 
  strength and feelings by trusting Six when they 
  have to deal with a perilous world. His continuous 
  desertion and fight for living change him into a 
  character of sorrow who is molded by loneliness and 
  pain, instead of heroism.</br></p>
