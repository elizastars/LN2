<h1><br>Little Nightmares and German Expressionism: Distorted Worlds and Inner Fear</br></h1>

  <p class="big">
<br>Little Nightmares II is a popular puzzle-platformer horror adventure 
game. There is a lot of symbolism in themes throughtout the game that 
players can see and hear. One of the themes we will be diving into is 
how the game and German Expressionism intertwine. Let's get started!</br></p>
<h1><br>Gameplay & What's at Stake</br></h1> 
  <p class="big">
<br>In Little Nightmares II, you take on the role of Mono, a frail boy. 
    Mono has to be stealthy, work out puzzles, and even engage in 
    battles at times to stay alive in an extremely terrifying realm. It 
    is very important that you are silent and your movements are 
    well-timed. Mono is supported by Six, a friend who resembles a video 
    game character. Six gives help to Mono by removing barriers. This 
    backing strengthens the feeling in Mono that he really needs Six and 
    that he can trust her. Not only is it a matter of survival for Mono. 
    Reaching the Signal Tower is another part of his task. The Signal 
    Tower communicates with people in a way that harms them and makes the 
    world odd. To put an end to these messages, Mono has to get to the 
    Signal Tower. Little Nightmares II proves to be a journey of Mono to 
    the Signal Tower. In the end, the game turns its challenge into a war 
    against a cycle of control and trauma instead of just a matter of 
    escaping from danger.</br>
<h1><br>Here's a Peek Into the Game!</br></h1>

<h1><br>Meet the Characters!</br></h1>
    <img src="monos.jpg" alt="Mono from Little Nightmares II">
<p class="big">
<br>Mono is a small, silent boy with a personality 
  of vulnerability and persistence. He uses a paper 
  bag for hiding and protection. Even though he 
  lacks physical strength, he shows his inner 
  strength and feelings by trusting Six when they 
  have to deal with a perilous world. His continuous 
  desertion and fight for living change him into a 
  character of sorrow who is molded by loneliness and 
  pain, instead of heroism.</br></p>
     <img src="six.jpg" alt="Six from Little Nightmares II">  
<p class="big">
<br>Six is Mono’s companion in Little Nightmares II, 
a small girl in a bright yellow raincoat whose silence 
and expressions convey both vulnerability and 
unpredictability. As the story progresses, she 
shifts from a cooperative survivor into a more 
unsettling figure, suggesting that the world’s 
violence and the Signal Tower’s influence are slowly 
changing her.</br></p>
<h1><br>Little Nightmares II Lore</br></h1>
  <p class="big">
<br>In Little Nightmares II Mono is a kid who gets a 
    strange call from a television. He meets a girl 
    named Six she is wearing a raincoat. They go 
    through places, like a weird school, a hospital 
    and a city called Pale that is covered in fog. 
    Mono finds out that he can use televisions to 
    control things by taking over their signals. 
    Most of the time Mono still needs Six to help him 
    figure out puzzles in Little Nightmares II. Mono 
    and Six work together to solve these puzzles in 
    the game Little Nightmares II. When Mono reaches 
    the Signal Tower, he confronts the Thin Man, along 
    with a corrupted Six because of the signal's 
    strength.</br></p>
<h1><br>Game Over??</br></h1>
  <p class="big">
<br>Little Nightmares II concludes with a rather 
disturbing and cyclic twist to its tale. After 
finally reaching the Signal Tower, a struggle 
ensues between Mono and the Thin Man, with Six 
being reintroduced, only to become corrupt due 
to the influence of the Tower. In the end, Six 
drops Mono, and over the course of time, he turns 
into the Thin Man. Thus, a cycle is repeated, as 
depicted in the story, where each victim turns 
out to be what they dreaded the most.</br></p>
<h1><br>Connection to German Expressionism</br></h1>
  <p class="big">
<br>A connection between the game 
and Expressionism would be its use 
of distorted architecture and 
unsettling spaces, which use fear 
and instability rather than real 
environments. Shadows and 
silhouettes in the game are very 
much like Expressionistic cinema, 
in that it emphasizes mood and states 
of being instead of real environments 
in its footage. Additionally, 
the non-human adult figures in 
the game, which are gruesome 
examples of dehumanized adults, 
characterize Expressionism’s 
critique of authority and loss 
of freedom. The game itself would 
be much like an Expressionistic 
movie, wherein trauma, control, 
and fate are given visible 
expression.There are also some 
audio from the game that has 
distortion to it which make 
the game a bit creepier.</br></p>
  <p class="big">
<br>The first audio clip is six 
    humming.</br></p>
<audio controls>
  <source src="six humming.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

  <p class="big">
<br>This second clip is six's humming, but distorted
whenever she becomes distorted too.</br></p>

<br>Here are some pictures of some characters and
gameplay that represent distortion.</br></p>

	<h1><br>Conclusion</br></h1>
  <p class="big">
<br>Little Nightmares II is engaging because it takes 
    typical gameplay and necessitates an emotionally 
    charged experience based on fear, vulnerability, 
    and trust. Little Nightmares II is significant 
    and educational as it requires players to learn 
    how to find meanings based on atmosphere, sounds, 
    and images rather than text or speech. This is an 
    engaging game as it maintains its players on edge 
    with suspense-based puzzles, stealth, and dangerous 
    situations. Ultimately, it shows how video games 
    can utilize interaction instead of storytelling for 
    exploring tough concepts such as trauma and control.</br></p>
