<br>Little Nightmares II is a popular puzzle-platformer horror adventure 
game. There is a lot of symbolism in themes throughtout the game that 
players can see and hear. One of the themes we will be diving into is 
how the game and German Expressionism intertwine. Let's get started!</br></p>
<h1><br>Gameplay & What's at Stake</br></h1> 
  <p class="big">
<br>In Little Nightmares II, you take on the role of Mono, a frail boy. 
    Mono has to be stealthy, work out puzzles, and even engage in 
    battles at times to stay alive in an extremely terrifying realm. It 
    is very important that you are silent and your movements are 
    well-timed. Mono is supported by Six, a friend who resembles a video 
    game character. Six gives help to Mono by removing barriers. This 
    backing strengthens the feeling in Mono that he really needs Six and 
    that he can trust her. Not only is it a matter of survival for Mono. 
    Reaching the Signal Tower is another part of his task. The Signal 
    Tower communicates with people in a way that harms them and makes the 
    world odd. To put an end to these messages, Mono has to get to the 
    Signal Tower. Little Nightmares II proves to be a journey of Mono to 
    the Signal Tower. In the end, the game turns its challenge into a war 
    against a cycle of control and trauma instead of just a matter of 
    escaping from danger.</br>

<h1><br>Little Nightmares II Lore</br></h1>
  <p class="big">
<br>Little Nightmares II follows Mono as he encounters Six and travels to the 
Signal Tower, the origin of a corrupting broadcast, via a warped world. Mono's 
bond with televisions and the Tower grows as they endure more dangerous 
surroundings, suggesting a more dire outcome. Six is changed inside the Tower, 
and Mono has to face the powers ruling the world. By the time the story ends, 
Mono has been abandoned, caught in a vicious cycle, and transformed into the 
monster he feared.</br></p>
<p class="big">
<br>Little Nightmares II is about Mono, a boy who wears a paper bag on his head. He joins forces with Six to make it through a scary world. This world is messed up because of a signal from a television. 
    Mono and Six go through a lot of places like the Wilderness, a School that's haunted a Hospital that is really gross and the Pale City which is falling apart. They have to avoid scary adults and 
    figure out puzzles. Mono keeps getting drawn to televisions that are connected to a hallway that feels like a dream. Mono and Six see a lot of stuff as they try to survive in Little Nightmares II. 
    They have to be careful, in this world. Their journey leads them to the Signal Tower, the source of the broadcast controlling the city, where Mono confronts the Thin Man and finds Six transformed 
    by the Tower’s influence. After Mono frees her by destroying her music box, Six ultimately betrays him during their escape, letting him fall into the Tower. The game ends by revealing that Mono 
    becomes the Thin Man himself, suggesting a tragic time loop and reinforcing the series’ themes of manipulation, abandonment, and the loss of childhood.</br></p>
<h1><br>Meet the Characters!</br></h1>
<p class="big">
<br>Mono is a small, silent boy with a personality of vulnerability and persistence. He uses a paper bag for hiding and protection. Even though he lacks physical strength, he shows his inner strength 
    and feelings by trusting Six when they have to deal with a perilous world. His continuous desertion and fight for living change him into a character of sorrow who is molded by loneliness and pain, 
    instead of heroism.</br></p>
